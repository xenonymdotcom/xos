to create a minimul boot image,
`sudo gparted`  then foramt the whole of a sd card as Fat32 (tries 2G and 4G cards) then set the boot flag (and I sometimes set lba)
then copy bootcode.bin and start.elf
the copy on kernel.img 

and Bob's ur uncle you have a booting setup.

as to which rev these are no idea, but the mailbox code works ;)
